A small Go webserver that gives back JSON weather data based on a city input.

Took an existing Go template for grabbing weather and fixed it up. Just an attempt to sharpen up on my rusty Golang.

Also fooling around with crosscompiling and deploying to a raspberry pi, with scripts for that process.

Note - to anyone trying to run this, get your OpenWeatherMap API key from the site and paste the key into the apiConfig-EXAMPLE template and rename that apiConfig
