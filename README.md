Took an existing Go template for grabbing weather and fixed it up. Just an attempt to sharpen up on my rusty Golang.

Note - to anyone trying to run this, get your OpenWeatherMap API key from the site and paste the key into the .apiConfig-EXAMPLE template and rename that .apiConfig

### Original wiki below

This is a basic learning project for programming in the [Go](http://golang.org/) language.  The project follows the "How I Start" example (see below).  Likewise, for security of the API keys for [OpenWeatherMap](http://www.openweathermap.org) and [Wunderground](http://www.wunderground.com/), we read the API keys from a JSON-format file named `.apiConfig`.
